        "Our vision is to create a secure, seamless, and human-centric digital identity ecosystem where people can move, access services, and verify themselves without friction, cards, tickets, passwords, or repeated identity checks. We aim to replace outdated, slow, and fraud-prone systems with a face-based, consent-driven identity layer that works across transport, smart cities, enterprises, and public infrastructure, while fully respecting privacy, choice, and legal boundaries. This project is not just a technology solution — it is digital public infrastructure for the next generation."
