How to Read This Document
Each sector is explained using a standard decision-maker format:
1.	Current Pain Points
2.	FacePass Usage Scenario
3.	How It Works (Location & Access Points)
4.	Security Risks & Prevention
5.	ROI & Efficiency Gains
________________________________________
1. Airports
1.1 Current Pain Points
●	Multiple document checks (ID, ticket, boarding pass)

1.2 FacePass Usage
Face becomes the single travel credential from terminal entry to aircraft boarding.
1.3 How It Works (Airport Locations)
●	Terminal entry gates: Face-based access
●	Check-in & baggage drop: Identity-linked booking validation
●	Security & boarding gates: Real-time entitlement verification
●	Arrival exit: Automatic journey completion
1.4 Security Risks & Prevention
●	Anti-spoofing & liveness detection
●	Identity bound to booking & time window
●	No ticket or QR misuse possible
1.5 ROI & Efficiency
●	Faster passenger throughput
●	Reduced staffing & fraud
●	Improved airport capacity utilization
