Why Current Systems Fail
1. Dependence on Physical Artifacts
Current travel systems are built around tickets, cards, printouts, and physical IDs. These artifacts:
●	Can be lost, damaged, or forgotten
●	Are easy to duplicate or misuse
●	Create dependency on paper, plastic, or devices
A traveler’s identity is external, not intrinsic to the system.

2. Fragmented & Siloed Systems
Each stakeholder operates independently:
●	Airlines issue boarding passes
●	Airports verify IDs
●	Immigration checks passports
●	Railways and metros validate tickets separately
There is no unified identity layer, forcing travelers to prove themselves repeatedly at every checkpoint.

3. Manual & Semi-Digital Verification
Most checkpoints still rely on:
●	Visual ID matching by staff
●	QR code or barcode scanning
●	Human judgment and manual intervention
This leads to:
●	Human error
●	Slower passenger movement
●	Inconsistent enforcement of rules

4. Poor Scalability for High-Volume Travel
As passenger volume grows:
●	Queues increase exponentially
●	Staffing requirements rise
●	Infrastructure becomes congested
Current systems do not scale efficiently for mega-population markets like India.

5. Security Gaps & Fraud Vulnerability
Physical and QR-based systems are prone to:
●	Ticket sharing and resale
●	ID impersonation
●	Fake or altered documents
Verification checks the document, not the person.

6. Device & Network Dependency
Digital tickets and IDs depend on:
●	Smartphones
●	Battery life
●	Internet connectivity
Failures occur when:
●	Phones are lost or discharged
●	Networks are weak or unavailable
Face-based identity works without devices at the point of access.

7. Poor Contactless Experience
Despite demand for touch-free travel:
●	Cards must be tapped
●	Phones must be scanned
●	Documents must be handled
This limits hygiene, speed, and user comfort.

8. High Operational & Compliance Cost
Operators must invest in:
●	Printing and ticketing systems
●	Access cards and scanners
●	Verification staff and training
●	Fraud investigation and audits
These costs grow with scale and complexity.

9. No Real-Time Identity Intelligence
Current systems cannot:
●	Instantly know who is present
●	Track journey continuity across modes
●	Enable predictive security or crowd control
Data exists, but identity is not persistent or interoperable.

10. Core Failure Summary
Existing travel systems are document-centric, not human-centric.
They verify what you carry, not who you are.
Without a persistent, secure, face-based identity layer, travel remains slow, fragmented, and vulnerable.
